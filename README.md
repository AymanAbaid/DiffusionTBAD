# 🩺 DiffusionTBAD: Synthetic CTA Images for Type B Aortic Dissection

**DiffusionTBAD** is a curated dataset of *synthetic* CT angiography (CTA) images focused on **Type B Aortic Dissection (TBAD)**. All images are generated using **text-to-image diffusion models**, providing a resource for advancing research in medical imaging, anomaly detection, and synthetic data augmentation.

## 🚀 How to Use the Tuned DreamBooth Model

To replicate or extend the dataset generation, follow these steps:

### 🔧 1. Install Requirements

```bash
git clone https://github.com/huggingface/diffusers
cd diffusers
pip install -e .
pip install transformers accelerate xformers safetensors
💡 It's recommended to use a virtual environment and a CUDA-compatible GPU for faster inference.

🧪 2. Load the Fine-Tuned DreamBooth Model
python
Copy
Edit
from diffusers import StableDiffusionPipeline
import torch

pipe = StableDiffusionPipeline.from_pretrained(
    "your-hf-username/tbad-dreambooth-model",
    torch_dtype=torch.float16
).to("cuda")

prompt = "Computed Tomography Angiography Type-B aortic dissection data with true lumen"
image = pipe(prompt).images[0]
image.save("tbad_sample.png")
⚙️ 3. Run Batch Generation (Optional)
To generate a large number of CTA images, you can loop through a list of prompts or metadata tags.

python
Copy
Edit
prompts = [
    "CTA of Type B Aortic Dissection, sagittal view, high contrast",
    "Aortic dissection with true and false lumen clearly visible",
    "Synthetic angiogram of TBAD with contrast dye"
]

for idx, p in enumerate(prompts):
    image = pipe(p).images[0]
    image.save(f"tbad_sample_{idx}.png")
Let us know if you'd like a full script with metadata integration and randomization!
